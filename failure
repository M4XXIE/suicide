I tried so hard to be a good person for people and all it ended up doing was getting me hated by everyone i loved the most. I just wish someone was there to help me out when I had no idea what to do. I know I'm not a good friend nor partner but I never had anyone there to teach me how to be good. My entire life has just been me getting fucking shitted on by other people for no fucking reason. I know I fuck up a lot of fucking times but all I wanted was just someone by my side. I'm not the best person when it comes to talking or anything due to my antisocial behavior from being bullied 24/7 throughout my life, but it would still be nice to have someone who cared as much as they did. I'm sorry for even being a burden to anyone's life anymore, and I'll be making my exit soon. I just wish I could've been a better person in this life and didn't fuck up as much as I did. I lost everyone that cared about me due to my selfish and irrational behavior. I lost the only people who loved me due to my stupid fucking mistakes and just overall the person I am. I want to change so fucking badly but I don't know if I can. Knowing I have to live with this guilt for the rest of my time alive is going to rot my fucking brain into suicide. I want to turn back time to 2020 and fix all my wrong-doings. I want to turn back time to before I joined any communities or did anything online. I want to turn back time to when I was happy again. I'm sorry to everyones lives that I've ruined or caused issues in, you wont have to deal with me for long. To rae, I love you so fucking much and I'm sorry I wasn't the best partner for you. I hope someone else could treat you 10x better than I ever could and could make you more happy than anything I tried doing. That's all I have to say, Goodbye.
